# Begginer Web Dev:
 
--To make a fully furnished website you need to follow these steps:

1: The UI part (I will do it later):




2: The Backend or the Server side (Coming Soon):
  Here i am going to learn and to handle all major important handle requests.




3: Database (coming after the Backend): 


4:Authentication and Security (It will take some time/ Coming after the website is ready):
